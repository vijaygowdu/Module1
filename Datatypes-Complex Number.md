## EX.NO:1(C)	DATA TYPES-COMPLEX NUMBER CREATION
## AIM:
To write a Python Program to read two numbers and convert and print them into a
Complex number and print the real and imaginary part of the complex number new
## ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a.

STEP 2: Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b.

STEP 3: Create a complex number x using the values of a and b by calling the complex () function with a and b as arguments.

STEP 4: Print the complex number x.

STEP 5: Print the real part of the complex number x using the real attribute.

STEP 6: Print the imaginary part of the complex number x using the imag attribute.


## PROGRAM:
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
``` 

## OUTPUT:
