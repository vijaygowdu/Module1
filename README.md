## EX.NO:1(A)	DATA TYPES -BOOLEAN EXPRESSION EVALUATION
## AIM:
To write a python program to print the result of the expression as True or False
## ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Set variable a equal to the result of the expression 0 == True.

STEP 2: Set variable b equal to the result of the expression False == False.

STEP 3: Set variable c equal to the result of the expression True + True.

STEP 4: Set variable d equal to the result of the expression False + 9.

STEP 5: Print the value of a along with the text "a is".

STEP 6: Print the value of b along with the text "b is".

STEP 7: Print the value of c along with the text "c:". 

STEP 8: Print the value of d along with the text "d:".

## PROGRAM:
```
a = (0 == True)
b = (False== False)
c = True + True
d = False + 9 print("a is", a)
print("b is", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
```
